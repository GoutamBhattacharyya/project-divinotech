-          Data encryption
-          Data Masking
-          Data backup

                            <p>Managing operation shift, employee attendance, leave balance, and integrating these with payroll management for an accurate calculation, can only be achieved through a leave management module. Its standalone or network-based operation is ideal for Schools, Hospitals, Government Institutes, Banks, Remote sites, Hotels, Small/Large Enterprises and many more. The module also eliminates the hassle of workforce scheduling by real-time visualization of manpower for a decided time frame. Integration of bio-metric and similar applications with the attendance management system makes it robust and reduces manual efforts.</p>

A well-structured payroll management system can eliminate errors and save time by reducing the hours spent by the respective departments to produce payroll information.

                            <p>An organization with various departments requires tasks to be precisely allocated, in order to move the wheel smoothly. Every individual has their own work limitations, and a good task management system allows the management to break down the requirements into small and executable tasks. It also gives them the provision of allocating those tasks to individuals, with the required skill set to execute them within the timeframe. Scheduling is one of the key features of the task management system. It creates transparency. A properly managed task management system acts as the central hub, having a continuous flow of tasks and also connects different departments and teams to collaborate and execute the daily tasks. Basic features of a task management system are </p>

Time tracking enables individuals to verify the time taken to finish a task and amend it, if necessary. It helps to record the daily, weekly or monthly time logs of the employees, automatically in timesheets. It then sends the report for approval, generates invoices, and bills the client on time. It validates all work hours and makes sure that nothing goes overlooked. All of this, if done manually can put a lot of pressure on the company or an individual. Whereas a task management module, backed up with a robust time tracking mechanism, can provide all these solutions with a few clicks. It helps to</p>

There are two versions of the chat platform, Manual chat platform and Interactive chat platform. 
Manual chat platform – It’s the traditional chat platform that is commonly used for end to end communication between users. Interactive chat platform- This is an advanced version of the chat mechanism and besides end to end communication, this kind of platform can be designed to perform a particular set of tasks through voice or texts. An interactive chat platform, which is backed up with AI (artificial intelligence), can automate many processes in the back end like task allocation, scheduling, time tracking, connecting users, answering queries, bank transfers etc.

                            <p>An ERP application, when placed online, can be accessed from any geographical location. An online ERP solution is preferable, as it wipes out the requirement for managing data files separately. The insights, tasks allocations, and performance can be monitored anytime anywhere. User level permission-based access makes the process even more secure.</p>

                            <p>ERP applications are integrated with different modules and functions to execute multiple business processes. End-user training is necessary for the right usage of the ERP application.

As digitization makes the operations more predictable, workflow tends to become smooth and effective.</p>

                <h1>Service Desk</h1>
                <p>The reason to incorporate the Service Desk is to guarantee that the clients get suitable help in a convenient way, whenever necessary. When users have issues with the company's items or administrations, they try to reach the Service Desk for help. The representatives must have easy access to the customer’s profile details, transactional information and other service tools, in order to manage the queries or concerns effectively. If required, these information should be forwarded to the next department, for providing a better solution. Such execution can be only possible if the representatives are provided with an efficiently synced and managed back-end.</p>

                            <p>Profile Management module ensures that the personal and professional details of the customers are cataloged. Every organization needs to oversee them, for the ideal utilization. The user profiles contain all the important and essential data about them. Provisions for adding custom data, social media plug-in and encryption of profile information make the module more efficient to deal with. This kind of modules can be observed on websites and E-commerce platforms as well.</p>

                            <p>Customer transactions are far more sensitive than any other processes. Each and every transaction should be treated with extreme caution and stored securely in the database. By integrating the transaction module with sales and products, ERP helps not only to manage but also reply to the user’s queries related to specific transactions.</p>

                            <p>The product and service distributions management module helps an organization analyze the movement of goods. It also helps to re-plan the supply. Once the distributions are cataloged in the system, the organization can channelize them in an efficient way for a cost-effective, time-saving and smooth distribution. Distribution channel helps distributors act as a value chain, through which products or services pass, until it reaches the consumer. Categorization of direct and indirect distribution channels, scheduling distribution of orders, and tracking them are the essential features of distribution channels.</p>

                            <p>In the ERP framework, constraint management cautions the user about the consequences of future operations failure and alerts them to fix the issue beforehand. This prevents the factors which might cause loss to the business. Constraint management is also used by employers to ensure that employees are focused on their work process. There are two types of constraints</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><p>1.   External constraint </p></li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>External constraint is when the company’s production exceeds the market demand. In this case, the business must create demand for the specific product in the market. Internal constraint is when the production is less than the market demand.<p>

                            <p>Acknowledgment management is a small but unique feature, which improves the relationship between the organization and end user. When the product/service is delivered, both the client and the administrator get an affirmation message. There are various types of acknowledgments like order confirmation, billing confirmation, shipment confirmation etc.</p>

When it is noticed that a particular product has picked up an unequivocal measure of achievement and the interest for that item has expanded, product renewal is arranged. When an item appears to be not fulfilling clients' needs, the production of that specific item is stopped. This leads to product discontinuation. Management of products through such categories makes the inventory identification precise and complete.
